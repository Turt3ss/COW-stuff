The COW programming language is an esoteric programming language created by Sean Heber in 2003. It is a Brainfuck variant designed humorously with Bovinae in mind. COW has twelve instructions (four more than Brainfuck) and is Turing-complete. Most instructions are moos, only the capitalization varies: mOo, moO, mOO, Moo, and so on. MMM, OOO, oom and OOM are the exceptions. All other character combinations are ignored and treated as comments.
